# Project Roadmap
# 1. Load & Explore Data

Read the dataset from the Excel file.

Check for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Understand the structure of the dataset (columns, datatypes, and distributions).

# 2.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values (imputation, removal, or replacement).

Convert categorical variables into numerical format (one-hot encoding or label encoding).

Normalize/scale numerical variables to ensure fair comparison.

# 3.Feature Selection & Engineering

Identify relevant features for clustering.

Perform correlation analysis to understand dependencies.

Consider dimensionality reduction before clustering.

# 4.Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, etc.)

Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

Fit clustering models and analyze results.

Visualize clusters using PCA and t-SNE.

# 5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Reduce dimensionality for better visualization.

Interpret principal components and variance explained.
